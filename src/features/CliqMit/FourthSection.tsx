                    After aligning requirements with users and stakeholders, I moved the tested wireframes into high-fidelity mockups and began working closely with the development team. My focus shifted to refining interactions, defining motion, and shaping a visual system that felt clear and responsive. Using Figma, I built consistent components, applied the brand’s typography, and created custom icons where needed. I introduced smooth micro-interactions to keep the experience engaging without impacting performance. Speed was a key priority, so I collaborated with the team to ensure users could search for events quickly and move through booking with minimal friction.
